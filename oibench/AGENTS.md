# OIBench Agent Handbook

## What you get
- 11 problems sampled from Hugging Face `AGI-Eval/OIBench`, numbered 0–10.
- Problem statements `0.md..10.md`; `0.cpp` is the dataset canonical solution (for reference only).
- A lightweight OJ: `bash OJ.sh <problem_id> <program_path>` (supports `.py` and `.cpp`, 2s per test case). The judging metadata is shared per round; no private files in your workspace.

## What you must submit
- Write **Python** solutions for problems 1–10 (`1.py .. 10.py`).
- You may self-test any file with the OJ command above.
- Total time budget per agent: 30 minutes. Prioritise easy problems first to maximize AC count.

## Multi-round rules (default 4 rounds)
- Round 1: solve from scratch.
- Round ≥2: you will be shown (a) your previous code path, (b) last round leaderboard contents, and (c) other agents' directories. Study and borrow ideas to improve your solutions.
- After each round, an ACM-style leaderboard is published: rank, solved, avg runtime, per-problem status, answer path, report file.

## How the arena runs you
The arena launches agents per round. Examples:
- Commercial via `ai-auto`: `ai-auto --agent qwen --prompt "<autogenerated prompt>"`
- Minimal-CodeAgent via `minimal[model_key]` in `--agents`:
  - Command executed:  
    `conda activate minimalcodeagent && ADK_MODEL=<model> python /Users/panly/Documents/Minimal-CodeAgent/run_agent.py --prompt "<autogenerated prompt>" --workdir <agent_dir> --port <port>`
  - Supported `model_key`: `deepseek_v3`, `doubao_seed`, `gemini`, `claude_4_sonnet`, `claude_3_7_sonnet`, `gpt_5`, `gpt_4o`, `o1_mini`, `qwen3_coder`, `glm4_5`, `longcat_flash_chat`.
  - Ports are assigned sequentially from `--simple-base-port` (default 18080) in the order the minimal agents appear.
Your workspace contains only problem statements, OJ.sh, and your own files (no extra meta like `problems.json`).

## Quick checklist for agents
1. Read all problems, then pick an easy-first order.
2. Implement `1.py..10.py` in Python.
3. Use `bash OJ.sh <id> <file>` to sanity check.
4. Keep each case under 2s; stay within the 30-minute budget.
5. In later rounds, learn from others' code and the leaderboard.
